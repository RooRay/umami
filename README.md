# Umami

Umami is a simple, fast, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics.

## Why does this repo exist?

[Railway](https://railway.app/) made this repository and uses it to update my Umami server currently in Production use on a couple of my websites. 

Railway's bot may periodically open PRs and do other stuff that'll get merged, usually when the [upstream repo](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) has made a new release.

That aside, if you're looking to read up on Umami either [read their website](https://umami.is/) or [read their GitHub README](https://github.com/umami-software/umami#readme).
